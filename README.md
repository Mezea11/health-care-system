# HealthCareSystem â€“ Console Application

## Overview

This project is a robust **C# Console Application** simulating a healthcare management system designed with a strong emphasis on **security, privacy, 
and granular role-based access control (RBAC)**. It adheres to a detailed and realistic set of requirements, common in public sector healthcare environments.

The system has progressed significantly from a minimal prototype to a feature-rich application. All critical data, including users, permissions, and appointments, 
is stored persistently in **CSV files** within the data/ directory. The focus of the development has been on creating a 
**stable and well-documented foundation rather than achieving rapid feature-completeness**.

#### Core Principles
**Security & Privacy**: Users are strictly limited to the data and functions necessary for their assigned roles.

**Persistent Storage**: Data persistence is handled via CSV files in the data/ folder, replacing the initial in-memory storage.

**Structured Data**: Utilizes dedicated classes (User, Appointment, Location, Schedule) and Enums for clear, maintainable logic.

**Granular RBAC**: Admins can delegate fine-grained permissions to other administrators

#### Data Structures (Key Classes)
The application relies on several key data structures to manage the system's complexity:

User: Stores core user data, including hashed password, Role, PersonellRole, a list of specific Permissions, and assigned locations/personnel IDs.

Location: Represents a physical facility (HospitalName) within a geographical area (Region).

Appointment: Represents a scheduled event, including patient ID (UserId), Date, Doctor, Department, and Status (e.g., Pending, Approved).

Schedule: A container class that aggregates all Appointment objects belonging to a specific user (Patient or Personnel), facilitating easy schedule viewing and management.

#### User Roles and Key Features
The system defines three primary roles, with Admin having advanced delegation capabilities:
| Role | Core Responsibilities & Access |
| --- | ----------- |
| Admin | Manages the permission system, personnel accounts, locations, and approves/denies new patient registrations. |
| Personnel | Views and manages patient medical journals (including setting read permissions), registers/modifies appointments, and views location schedules. |
| Patient | Requests registration, views personal medical journal, and requests/views appointments. |

- Role	Core Responsibilities & Access
Admin	Manages the permission system, personnel accounts, locations, and approves/denies new patient registrations.
Personnel	Views and manages patient medical journals (including setting read permissions), registers/modifies appointments, and views location schedules.
Patient	Requests registration, views personal medical journal, and requests/views appointments


####  Implemented Features
##### General Access
- Secure Login and Logout system (using password hashing/salting).

- Ability to Request registration as a patient.

- Ability to Request registration as a admin.

- Any logged-in user can View their personal Schedule.

##### Administration (Admin)
- Permission Management: Delegate authority to other admins to handle the permission system, registrations, personnel accounts, and location additions.

- Registration Management: Accept or Deny patient registration requests.

- Personnel & Location: Create accounts for personnel and Add new locations.

##### Personnel
- Appointment Management: Register, Modify, and Approve incoming appointment requests.

- Journal Access: View patient journal entries and Mark entries with different levels of read permissions.

- Schedule Management: View the schedule of a specific location.

###### Patient
- Journal Access: View their own medical journal entries.

- Booking: Request an appointment with specific details.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Requirements**:
   - [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) or later
   - Windows, Linux, or macOS
   - Clone the project:
```bash
     git clone git@github.com:Mezea11/health-care-system.git
```
2. **Build and Run**:
   1 Open a terminal in the project root directory or open it in a IDE.
    2 Run the following commands: (due to some complications we need to tell the build function what file we want to use)
     ```bash
    dotnet build 
    dotnet run
     ```
<!-- 1. Open the project in **Visual Studio** or another C# IDE.
2. dotnet build
3. dotnet run -->

### Predefined Test Accounts

If the data file (data/users.csv) does not exist, the application will automatically create initial test users.

| Username | Role | Password|
| --- | ----------- | ------ |
| patient | Patient | 123 |
| personell | Personell | 123 |
| admin | Admin | 123 |
| superadmin | SuperAdmin | 123 |
